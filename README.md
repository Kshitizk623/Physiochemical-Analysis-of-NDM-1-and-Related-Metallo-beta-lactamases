# Physiochemical-Analysis-of-NDM-1-and-Related-Metallo-beta-lactamases

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of the physiochemical properties of NDM-1 (New Delhi Metallo-beta-lactamase-1) and other MBL across different bacterial species.

The goal is to better understand their mechanisms of antibiotic resistance and to aid in the development of effective inhibitors and treatment strategies.
